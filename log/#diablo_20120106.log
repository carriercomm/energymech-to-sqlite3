[00:02:10] <Thunderclaww> if you have a decent computer
[00:02:19] <Taffer> I love how google is making their browser multi purpose
[00:02:43] <Taffer> the best google addon though is the chrome to phone, since I have android. Sends whatever I am looking at directly to my phone
[00:03:19] * Anime hates phones and has none
[00:03:35] <Taffer> they aren't phones anymore, they are mini tablets
[00:03:41] <Anime> true
[00:03:45] <Taffer> I read reddit on the bus to school, it's awesome
[00:03:49] <Taffer> but I don't talk much on it haha
[00:03:58] <Anime> i wonder where the heck they named them tablets
[00:04:09] <Anime> for all my existance, tablets were the electronic drawing boards
[00:04:17] <Anime> now you can't find a friggin wacom typing that anymore
[00:04:18] <Taffer> you cna still draw on them
[00:04:33] <Taffer> I want a wacom with a screen, my life will be complete
[00:04:57] <Anime> you can still draw, but not really the same purpose tho

[01:05:49] <krackpot> How did that "news" leak that it would be out before 2012?
[01:06:07] <krackpot> Everyone was expecting a Dec release back in Aug/Sept/Oct
[01:06:21] <Taffer> these changes have been worked on for a long time I would think, and we get to see it on the beta client
[01:07:16] <Taffer> I know everyone is getting ants in their pants, but I want diablo 3 out when they think it's ready
[01:07:18] <Anime> 'that's all' hahahah
[01:07:41] <krackpot> I hope you never get your wish
[01:07:45] <Anime> the secret is to stop going after info and your hype eventually settles down
[01:07:50] <krackpot> We'll NEVER have it by then
[01:08:01] <krackpot> I CAN'T STOP
[01:08:04] <Taffer> from what I have played via beta, they are pretty close
[01:10:45] <Anime> The programme is listed in Guinness World Records as the longest-running science fiction television show in the world,[
[01:10:49] <Anime> 1963 >_<
[01:11:23] <TafferM> The new doctor is awesome,  i get people into the show with him
[01:11:49] <Anime> The Doctor has been principally played by eleven actors. The transition from one actor to another is written into the plot of the show as regeneration, whereby the character of the Doctor takes on a new body and, to some extent, new personality. 
[01:11:50] <Anime> hahahaha
[01:12:11] <krackpot> I just checked. A release date hasn't been confirmed.
[01:12:24] * krackpot punches himself out
[01:12:27] <TafferM> Yep,  the transfers are really well done too
[01:13:41] <Anime> there were no series between 96 and 05?
[01:15:17] <TafferM> Yeah,  huge gap and revival and show change 
[01:16:02] <TafferM> 9th doctor only lasted a season haha
[01:17:29] <Anime> was he bad?
[01:26:18] <TafferM> Nah I liked him,  but the next 2 were definitely better fits

[22:38:06] <Taffer> i should be streaming D1 tonight
[22:38:09] <krackpot> I hope the reason why they're delaying the game this much is that they intend to make one huge server aka "North America" by combining US East and West to make a huge market for the auction house
[22:38:37] <Taffer> i hope it's because they want to put out a game they feel is done
[22:38:38] <krackpot> And they're working on networking and server/database problems
[22:38:47] <Taffer> is the patch out?
[22:39:10] <krackpot> Or waiting out for expensive HDDs to come down
[22:39:18] <krackpot> So they can host all of our characters
[22:39:21] <Anime> lol
[22:39:22] <krackpot> I don't think it's out
[22:39:31] <Anime> i want me a ssd :/
[22:39:48] <Anime> but waiting, 128gb are still out of my league
[22:39:50] <krackpot> Go get one. I bought another SSD around boxing day
[22:39:57] <Anime> 64 is just too small
[22:40:08] <krackpot> Cause paying 200-300 for a regular HDD is  ridiculous
[22:40:29] <krackpot> 64 will be too small IMO
[22:40:30] <Taffer> i paid 112
[22:40:44] <Taffer> didnnt come with a box or cables though
[22:40:48] <krackpot> I paid 160 for a 160GB Intel 320 series
[22:40:54] <Taffer> just a hDD in bubble wrap and a beat up amazon box

[22:52:58] <Taffer> I can't wait till those go down in price and up in storage
[22:53:08] <Taffer> far too little space for me
[22:53:44] <Anime> just for the os at least
[22:53:45] <Anime> and installed stuff
[22:55:07] <Taffer> yeah but what's the point of that when you need speed accessing game files as well?
[22:55:16] <Taffer> and most games are 15+gigs now days
[22:55:56] <Anime> install games on the ssd :P
[22:56:06] <Anime> unless you have 500 games and want all of them at the same time
[22:56:41] <Anime> but you have a point, only 10 big games, but it works for me tho
[22:56:58] <Anime> i'll only need 3 big ones
[22:57:22] <Taffer> think of music, PSD files if you work in photoshop, movies and temp files too
[22:57:36] <Anime> im free of mp3s
[22:57:45] <Anime> got tired of downloading them lolol
[22:57:53] <Anime> stuck to radios
[22:58:48] <Anime> movies will have to still sit in mechanical ones though
[22:58:53] <Anime> 30gb files :(
[22:59:51] <Thunderclaww> I have an SSD that hold my OS, Diablo 3 Beta, and a few other things
[22:59:58] <Thunderclaww> then my HDD holds everything else
[23:14:01] <Taffer> jelly
[23:14:12] <Taffer> stupid virtual machine not working how I want it to.
[23:14:27] <Taffer> I want to play diablo 1 but I can't stretch the window, I think I have to lower my normal desktop res
