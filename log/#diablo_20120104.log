[16:47:43] <Darkie> nope
[16:47:58] <Chaosteil> ouch man
[16:48:04] <Chaosteil> I thought you were going to say 4gig to 8gig
[16:48:17] <Chaosteil> that is indeed a good upgrade now
[16:48:23] <Darkie> might be
[16:48:30] <Darkie> but I only have 2 slots
[16:48:42] <Darkie> and nobody at my firm buys 4gig rams
[16:48:45] <Darkie> because hey
[16:48:48] <Darkie> it's romania
[16:48:58] <Darkie> who needs 8gigs of ram to process word documents?
[16:48:58] <Chaosteil> depends on the company I guess
[16:49:08] <Darkie> yeah
[16:49:38] <Darkie> the servers that hold the salary calculating thing-mabob have 64 gigs or ram though

[16:51:59] <Darkie> probably
[16:52:00] <Chaosteil> 's hard to make
[16:52:01] <Darkie> anyways
[16:52:07] <Darkie> have you tried swtor?
[16:52:13] <Chaosteil> oh no
[16:52:25] <Chaosteil> the next mmo I'll play will either be firefall or guild wars 2

[16:53:30] <Chaosteil> I was rather finishing assrev, playing skyrim and other crap
[16:54:04] <Chaosteil> it's hard to move to other mmos when you're so used to wow's polish
[16:54:22] <Darkie> it's quite polished too
[16:54:30] <Darkie> that's the thing - questing in the game is quite awesome
[16:54:40] <Darkie> it's awesome in wow nowadays too
[16:54:54] <Darkie> but the mass effect style dialogue and whatnot makes it much better
[16:55:11] <Chaosteil> yeah, that was one thing that made me go "well maybeeee"
[16:55:22] <Chaosteil> but then no, I really shouldn't do this
[16:55:41] <Chaosteil> so I bought other awesome stuff to make myself happy
[16:56:02] <Darkie> I got bf3 for 20 quid :P
[16:56:11] <Chaosteil> is swtor really the single player game they say it is?
[16:56:14] <Chaosteil> that's cool
[16:56:18] <Chaosteil> origin though!
[16:56:38] <Darkie> yeah, I know
[16:56:41] <Darkie> but it's no big deal
[16:57:06] <Chaosteil> taffer is very fond of bf3 as far as I know
[16:57:12] <Darkie> it's a nice game
[16:57:19] <Darkie> but I can't say it's the awesomest or whatever
[16:57:38] <Darkie> you can play it single player all the way to 50
[16:58:04] <Darkie> the only multiplayer stuff is dailies, raids, dungeons and bgs
[16:58:26] <Chaosteil> are the dungeons good?
[16:59:18] <Darkie> dunno just yet
[16:59:24] <Darkie> I'm only lvl 16 and there's no lfd in the game
[17:00:14] <Darkie> I've heard the first one is awesome and amazing

[17:00:18] <Darkie> it's not really a dungeon per se
[17:00:23] <Darkie> it's more like a tiny story
[17:00:33] <Darkie> that you play through with your friendsies
[17:00:40] <Darkie> then the next few are a bit meh
[17:00:46] <Darkie> since the first one is so much better 
[17:00:59] <Darkie> and then the higher level ones are awesome again
[17:01:01] <Chaosteil> to get you hooked, obviously
[17:01:05] <Chaosteil> how 'bout the combat?
[17:02:20] <Darkie> it's much more spectacular than wow's
[17:02:36] <Darkie> I'm playing a trooper and I'm throwing lasers and nades all over the place
[17:02:47] <Darkie> the jedi and sith look like a lot of fun too
[17:02:56] <Darkie> and having a constant companion is quite awesome too
[17:04:32] <Darkie> there's one thing about this game though
[17:04:39] <Darkie> it makes me miss galactic battlegrounds
[17:04:51] <Darkie> you know, that AoE2 engine star wars game?
[17:05:00] <Chaosteil> i.e. you want a new star wars battlefront?
[17:05:05] <Chaosteil> I'm afraid not
[17:05:17] <Darkie> not battlefront
[17:05:29] <Darkie> that's something else entirely
[17:05:30] <Darkie> wait

[17:05:52] <Darkie> this
[17:06:04] <Chaosteil> didn't know about this

[17:06:18] <Darkie> try to find it
[17:06:27] <Darkie> it's basically age of empires with star wars
[17:06:32] <Chaosteil> already looked it up
[17:06:34] <Chaosteil> I'm fast
[17:07:12] <Darkie> :P
[17:07:21] <Darkie> I used to play it when I was 15 or so
[17:07:29] <Darkie> hated the fact that I had nobody to play it with...
[17:11:05] <Darkie> An expansion pack, Clone Campaigns, was released in 2002, adding two new factions and campaigns.
[17:11:15] <Darkie> it's not exactly the most worth it of the pack
[17:11:17] <Darkie> but it's nice
[17:12:11] <Darkie> it adds the trade federation from episode 2 and the clone trooper faction
[17:12:18] <Chaosteil> doesn't look like something you'd recommend these days too
[17:12:41] <Darkie> well
[17:12:47] <Darkie> aoe has been an ageless game
[17:12:54] <Darkie> I still love it now
[17:12:58] <Darkie> I'm getting it now too
[17:13:06] <Chaosteil> haha
[17:13:14] <Darkie> sure it's an old game
[17:13:15] <Darkie> but hey
[17:13:15] <Chaosteil> I have the gold edition right here in my shelf
[17:13:21] <Chaosteil> with unit lists and all that
[17:13:28] <Chaosteil> technology trees
[17:13:41] <Darkie> well, this is star wars aoe, with licensing and voices from the movies and all
[17:13:48] <Chaosteil> figured
[17:15:01] <Darkie> only with added pew pew
[17:15:13] <Darkie> having huge infantry battles is quite cool
[17:15:20] <Darkie> also the monks are now jedi or sith
[17:15:33] <Darkie> and they look awesome as well as being quite deadly
[17:15:39] <Darkie> they don't deflect lasers though
[17:16:18] <Chaosteil> that really sounds like a simple reskin
[17:16:41] <Darkie> it is, and I think that's the beauty of it!
[17:16:42] <Darkie> :P
[17:16:53] <Chaosteil> heh :D
[17:17:01] <Darkie> it's definitely star wars though
[17:17:21] <Chaosteil> mh, while I adore star wars and so on
[17:17:24] <Chaosteil> star trek > star wars
[17:17:25] <Chaosteil> sorry
[17:18:40] <Darkie> to each their own
[17:18:45] <Darkie> while I liked star trek
[17:18:46] <Chaosteil> lucky me, that star trek mmo will go free to play this month if I recall correctly
[17:19:01] <Darkie> I was too young to fully understand it back when star wars was fresh in my mind
[17:19:17] <Chaosteil> I recommend to rewatch everything
[17:19:22] <Chaosteil> or well, at least TNG
[17:21:15] <Darkie> I would
[17:21:16] <Darkie> but...
[17:21:19] <Darkie> waaay tooo loooong!
[17:21:44] <Chaosteil> I feel ya
[17:21:45] <Chaosteil> :D
[17:22:32] <Darkie> I mean
[17:22:40] <Darkie> I've watched the entirety of how I met your mother
[17:22:54] <Darkie> but each of those episodes are 20 minutes long
[17:23:00] <Chaosteil> yeah
[17:23:05] <Chaosteil> you just have to get in the mood for TNG
[17:23:14] <Chaosteil> as if you're rewatching battlestar galactica
[17:23:17] <Chaosteil> which are also 45min a pop
[17:25:19] <Darkie> :">
[17:25:25] <Darkie> haven't watched battlestar either :P
[17:25:31] <Darkie> nor most of stargate
[17:25:34] <Chaosteil> dude
[17:25:36] <Chaosteil> like
[17:25:37] <Chaosteil> woah

[17:26:34] <Darkie> hey, i'm still young :P
[17:26:55] <Chaosteil> yeah well
[17:27:04] <Chaosteil> but think about how the internet totally destroyed your attention span
[17:27:13] <Darkie> well
[17:27:14] <Darkie> yeah
[17:27:15] <Chaosteil> I had problems with watching breaking bad, as entertaining as it is
[17:27:15] <Darkie> but
[17:27:21] <Chaosteil> also 45 min a pop
[17:27:22] <Darkie> saiyans :(
[17:27:55] <Darkie> I mean
[17:28:06] <Darkie> I've watched and rewatched the entirety of the dragon ball series
[17:28:14] <Darkie> and that's quite long and damn repetitive
[17:28:18] <Darkie> but I was a kid :)
[17:30:02] <Chaosteil> oh yeah me too
[17:30:06] <Chaosteil> that was great
[17:30:26] <Darkie> my usual nickname when darkie is taken
[17:30:31] <Darkie> and where darkie is actually from
[17:30:33] <Darkie> is darksaiyanb
[17:30:38] <Darkie> darksaiyan*
[17:30:45] <Chaosteil> :|
[17:30:48] <Chaosteil> I'm sorry
[17:31:03] <Darkie> why?
[17:31:24] <Darkie> I don't mean here on irc
[17:31:28] <Darkie> anywhere really
[17:31:39] <Darkie> though I'm more partial to Darkenson nowadays
[17:36:50] <Chaosteil> more unique?
[17:38:27] <Darkie> I guess
[17:38:32] <Darkie> more elevated too, I guess
[17:38:44] <Darkie> dbz references are a bit teenagerish
