[00:05:43] <Taffer> he was doing dungeons as adult link when you are supposed to be young link too
[00:05:52] <Taffer> Anime:  what is your favorite diablo wiki?
[00:06:11] <Anime> i always used arreat summit for info
[00:06:44] <Anime> glitch run?
[00:06:51] <Taffer> not helpful for d3 :P
[00:06:52] <Taffer> and yes
[00:07:20] <Anime> for d3 im not going after info anymore
[00:07:40] <Taffer> I am thinking about adding stuff to a wiki for the long run, and trying to pick one to set my feet in
[00:07:47] <Taffer> I really liked this wiki for d2 and d3 they have good info
[00:07:48] <Taffer> http://www.diablowiki.net/Main_Page
[00:07:57] <Taffer> but missing stuff for some things like lord of lies :)
[00:08:08] <Taffer> while http://diablo.wikia.com/wiki/Diablo_III has lord of lies info
[00:08:23] <Anime> lol @ glitches
[00:08:46] <Taffer> majoras mask is next
[00:09:22] <Taffer> boss fight will take longer than the water temple
[00:09:42] <Anime> i used to visit http://diablo.incgamers.com/, but never a wiki
[00:11:35] <Anime> Best Buy thinks Diablo 3 is coming out on February 1, 2012
[00:11:36] <Taffer> that dude is tired
[00:11:38] <Anime> duhr
[00:11:44] <Taffer> best buy is stupid
[00:13:17] <Anime> bnet also being stupid
[00:13:26] <Anime> first i always played sc2 on NA
[00:13:29] <Anime> my reg is set to LA now
[00:13:38] <Anime> i set my gamertag a few days ago, now its unset
[00:14:03] <Taffer> =/
[00:14:12] <krackpot> Taffer: I like the design/logo of this site, but it has no real content
[00:14:14] <krackpot> http://d3db.com/home
[00:14:37] <Taffer> that's not a wiki
[00:15:12] <krackpot> True, but I think they started the site wanting it to be a  library of info
[00:15:16] <krackpot> Just not wiki style
[00:16:02] <Taffer> yeah that means only they add info unless giving the option
[00:16:13] <Taffer> and wikis are able to almost be fully edited by the people
[00:16:37] <Taffer> i think zam does info pulls and compiles it
[00:17:04] <Taffer> I remember when they were talking big for eq2
[00:18:36] <Taffer> good luck cosmo
[00:19:24] <Thunderclaww> Was this wiki mentioned yet? http://www.diablowiki.com/Diablo_III_Wiki
[00:19:49] <Taffer> nope, ty :)
[00:20:12] <Taffer> personally like that one?
[00:20:30] <Thunderclaww> Well, I like Diablofans and this one is linked with it
[00:20:59] <Thunderclaww> they have weekly/biweekly forum posts about any new updates
[00:21:33] <Taffer> woiw
[00:21:34] <Thunderclaww> and quite a lot of content on D3
[00:21:35] <Taffer> impressive
[00:23:02] <Taffer> always a good sign when you see a new video
[00:26:49] <Taffer> link me all the d3 news sites
[00:26:52] <Taffer> got diablo fans
[00:26:59] <Taffer> incgamers blizzplanet and d3sanc
[00:27:04] <Thunderclaww> d3db
[00:27:29] <Thunderclaww> those are the ones that I'm aware of
[00:31:24] <krackpot> What ever happened to Arreat Summit?
[00:31:33] <krackpot> I used to go to that site all the time for D2 stuff
[00:31:37] <Thunderclaww> It was the official D2 site
[00:31:39] <krackpot> Even though it wasn't very accurate
[00:31:43] <krackpot> Really?
[00:32:03] <Thunderclaww> I thought so
[00:33:35] <Taffer> they won't do it for d3
[00:33:41] <Taffer> they want third part sites to run that stuff
[00:37:23] <Taffer> ok sidebar updated
[00:38:07] <Thunderclaww> Woo, my Chrome theme is there
[00:38:14] <Taffer> been there
[00:38:21] <Taffer> put it up there yesterday

[00:53:51] <Thunderclaww> February 1st?
[00:56:27] <krackpot> I hope so

[00:56:48] <Taffer> blizzard has said many times that we will know when eveyone else knows
[00:57:00] <Taffer> the midnight opening text really bothers me
[00:57:15] <Taffer> look at the angle
[00:57:52] <Thunderclaww> There's almost no way D3 will be ready for Feb 1st
[00:58:34] <Taffer> i agree with that
[00:59:58] <Anime> how full is the beta these days?
[01:00:13] <Taffer> games fill up on the last quest pretty often
[01:00:47] <Taffer> how close do you think he is Anime 
[01:00:52] <Taffer> to beating it
[01:00:55] <krackpot> Yeah. On closer look and a comment made on that thread stated February is spelled incorrectly :(
[01:00:56] <Taffer> he has been pretty flawless
[01:02:25] <Taffer> stream may of died
[01:03:26] <Thunderclaww> Joystiq published an article with that image, saying it "looks pretty legit".

[01:10:19] <krackpot> Dunno. Nothing
[01:10:26] <Taffer> what do you use?
[01:10:38] <krackpot> Just needs a lot of customization or a good script to make it better
[01:10:47] <krackpot> I just can't be bothered to do that stuff anymore :P
[01:10:52] <Taffer> yeah I have used it before and got frustrated with it
[01:11:23] <krackpot> The last time I used it was before they had all those trees and multi server options etc. Got too complicated for me. So I ditched it for Xchat2
[01:11:38] <krackpot> It's this one: http://www.silverex.org/news/
