[01:53:02] <Epsyjuice> Whats the best way to get banned from a forum?
[01:53:54] <Epsyjuice> Somethingawful forums.. I just can't believe how dense they are in the gaming forums. Everybody posts sources for their debates, no one bothers to read them, then the next page later they get back to that same argument and cry out about no sources >.>
[01:59:15] <Anime> -_-
[01:59:18] <Anime> hate people like that
[02:00:00] <Epsyjuice> I posted that blog that discusses the RMAH and korea link
[02:00:02] <Epsyjuice> on there
[02:00:11] <Epsyjuice> and its started this massive bitching back and forth fest
[02:00:32] <Epsyjuice> No one reads anything apparently, they just go off what their friends friends said one time
[02:01:03] <Epsyjuice> I just talked about the different fees blizzard is imposing. the flat fee, the transaction fee, and the percentage cash out fee
[02:01:13] <Epsyjuice> posted a blue post pretty much saying it verbatim
[02:01:47] <Epsyjuice> and the guy was like no matter what you do, blizzard will make the same amount of money. no percentages. -.-
[02:02:27] <Epsyjuice> it originally was just brought up because I said hypothetically, blizzard could limit drop rates for items to artificially inflate the demand for them
[02:02:46] <Epsyjuice> It seems like something that /diablo would have a lot more civil conversation about
[02:03:47] <Epsyjuice> limit drop rates as needed*

[02:24:23] <Anime> blizzard could limit drop rates for items to artificially inflate the demand for them
[02:24:24] <Anime> they couldn't
[02:24:27] <Anime> they will.
[02:27:40] <Epsyjuice> what are you saying
[02:28:13] <Epsyjuice> I think they might occasionally like make a suffix on an item stop appearing just to make it more wanted

[03:52:20] <krackpot> Haven't they been accused of messing around with stuff like that before?
[03:52:46] <krackpot> That's why all the patches in D2 never fully get rid of the "white" or billions of SoJs
[03:53:24] <krackpot> They purposefully leave holes to dupe because those with control have a personal vested interest in it
[04:21:18] <Anime> they have been accused of creating priv dupe methods and having a share of what some d2 item sites make, iirc

[12:57:17] <skippydippy> can you go 'invisible' in the beta, so your other bnet friends can't see you ?
[12:57:28] <skippydippy> i always found that annoying that you couldn't do that in sc2
[13:05:33] <Chaosteil> I don't believe so, no
[13:14:08] <skippydippy> that sucks :(
[13:17:39] <skippydippy> is it still possible to get into the beta ?
[13:52:13] <Chaosteil> of course it is, but you know
[13:52:24] <Chaosteil> most of us are still trying to get in
