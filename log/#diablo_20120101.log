[19:51:15] <bellows> anyone here?
[19:51:21] <Epsyjuice> hi
[19:51:40] <bellows> anyone playing d2?
[19:51:46] <bellows> reddit sent me here
[19:52:24] <Epsyjuice> welcome!
[19:55:12] <bellows> east or west coast?
[19:55:50] <Epsyjuice> when I play, which is extremely rarely anymore on d2, i play on /slashdiablo
[20:16:09] <Anime> ohai
[20:17:33] <Epsyjuice> yo
[20:19:37] <Anime> holy crap
[20:19:38] <Anime> gigantic post
[20:21:45] <Epsyjuice> I posted it on somethingawful and they are like hes full of shit, he has no sources, hes explained everything -.-
[20:22:12] <Anime> i stopped caring
[20:22:20] <Anime> it'll be out when its out
[20:22:46] <Epsyjuice> Its out of my system, the whole checking for beta constantly
[20:22:50] <Anime> stopped going after info/media/gameplay and eventually your hunger for it settles down
[20:23:00] <Epsyjuice> Im starting to find the politics of the korea thing interesting
[20:23:08] <Anime> its good in a way too, when its out everything will be new
[20:23:09] <Epsyjuice> learning about the laws and how it all works
[20:23:16] <Anime> hm
[20:23:18] <Anime> tl;dr :x
[20:23:24] <Anime> how does it work? lol
[20:23:34] <Epsyjuice> its illegal to gamble in Korea
[20:23:41] <Epsyjuice> so they are trying to determine if this is gambling
[20:23:42] <Anime> uhh...
[20:24:14] *** Quits: Eddga (jackpot@188.32.108.204) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[20:24:21] <Epsyjuice> another issue is the rating
[20:24:27] <Epsyjuice> if you let minors play this
[20:24:32] <Epsyjuice> and this somehow happens to be gambling
[20:24:44] <Epsyjuice> but they let the fact that it is gambling slide
[20:25:20] <Epsyjuice> that might be contributing to the whole cultural problem of video game addiction even more
[20:25:45] <Epsyjuice> What exactly is gambling though?
[20:26:06] <Epsyjuice> if I just say hey, I bet that this dice is gonna land on 6 and it happens to be 5, did I gamble?
[20:26:17] <Epsyjuice> thats all we're doing in diablo.. I don't see how it is gambling
[20:26:38] <Epsyjuice> we aren't winning money if it happens to be 6, and losing if it isnt
[20:27:20] <krackpot> They're scared of how their society will handle a game where you can farm items and make money IMO
[20:27:50] <krackpot> You remember the guy who sat at an internet cafe for 3 days straight before he died playing SC or some Blizz game
[20:28:09] <Epsyjuice> or the couple who were taking care of their virtual baby so much they let the real one die
[20:28:15] <Anime> i spent 70h once paying d2 straight :/
[20:28:22] <Anime> eating and going to the bathroom only
[20:28:29] <krackpot> Didn't eat, and after a while didn't even bother to do biological functions
[20:28:40] <Anime> then i remembered that korean guy and left to sleep, even though i wasnt'asleep at all
[20:28:44] <krackpot> That's what they're scared of
[20:28:44] <Epsyjuice> my parents and i didnt eat very much one weekend. just played diablo 2 all day
[20:28:50] <Epsyjuice> the 3 of us
[20:28:53] <Anime> O_O
[20:28:58] <Anime> diablo with parents :~
[20:29:03] <Anime> must be cool
[20:29:09] <krackpot> Heh

[21:40:40] <Anime> d2?
[21:40:44] <SharkUW> yeah
[21:40:50] <Anime> haven't been playing it for a few years already..
[21:41:19] <SharkUW> I haven't played d2 in a very long time
[21:42:13] <Anime> :P
[21:45:09] <SharkUW> it's so tiny. lol

[21:57:04] <Epsyjuice> ill pay you in love
[21:58:52] <SharkUW> hookers and blow only
[21:59:33] <Epsyjuice> do you have d3? :<
[21:59:54] <SharkUW> nope, but I don't have hookers and blow either
[22:00:21] <SharkUW> just trying to get D2 working right now
[22:00:36] <Epsyjuice> you get me an account with d3 on it, and ill ship you some hookers and blow
[22:01:08] <Epsyjuice> the hooker might take more than one box though
[22:02:34] <SharkUW> I prefer whole midget hookers of multi-part standard hookers

[22:18:56] <Epsyjuice> I'm gonna make a wild guess here
[22:19:05] <Epsyjuice> your key is probably disabled o.o
[22:19:29] <SharkUW> gives the same message for play.slashdiablo.net
[22:19:34] <Epsyjuice> Hmm
[22:19:48] <SharkUW> tried it with just d2 and now also with LoD
[22:19:50] <Epsyjuice> maybe something with your registry is corrupt?
[22:19:58] <SharkUW> fresh install
[22:20:04] <SharkUW> same error, second fresh install
