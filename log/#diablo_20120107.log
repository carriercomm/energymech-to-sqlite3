[03:51:21] <TafferM> This is unplayable 
[03:52:01] <krackpot> It's unwatchable :(
[03:52:08] <Taffer> i know, looking into it
[03:56:07] <krackpot> You already beat D1?
[03:57:45] <Taffer> found the issue
[03:57:47] <Taffer> going live soon
[03:57:52] <Taffer> and no, killed the butcher though
[03:57:53] <Taffer> badly
[03:57:53] <krackpot> Woot
[03:57:56] <krackpot> Heh
[03:58:07] <krackpot> My first butcher kill was not glorious
[03:58:15] <krackpot> It was fighting like a little bitch
[03:58:16] <Taffer> what clas do you want to see krack?
[03:58:29] <krackpot> I'd like Monk if you wouldn't mind
[03:58:35] <Taffer> love it, thank you haha
[03:58:43] <krackpot> I always wanted to play that the second I saw that archtype
[03:59:05] <Taffer> my fav :)
[03:59:22] <Taffer> should be live, I will have irc on my phone on
[03:59:39] <krackpot> Cool
[04:00:26] <TafferM> Running good? 
[04:02:08] <krackpot> Yup :)
[04:03:14] <TafferM> Not skipping dialog
[04:07:07] <TafferM> Let me know if there is a skill you want to see krack
[04:07:39] <krackpot> I've not seen much of the "not popular skills". In fact I know nothing about his skills
[04:23:17] <krackpot> Does that level up blast hurt enemies?
[04:23:21] <krackpot> Or just pushback?
[04:23:53] <TafferM> Hurts them aoe I believe
[04:24:41] <TafferM> This tucker killed me in d1 today
[04:31:34] <krackpot> He doesn't seem too put off for having to have to put down his wife
[04:33:03] <TafferM> He knew she was already bitten
[04:33:13] <TafferM> You have to do it
[04:33:31] <TafferM> Here will show you
[04:34:00] <TafferM> He may talk about her after the crown
[04:37:43] <TafferM> Want all the dialog?  :) 
[04:38:22] <Darkie> I'm ok with however you wish to play it
[04:42:58] <krackpot> I agree with Darkie
[04:45:12] <TafferM> Kk :) 
[04:52:38] <TafferM> Yay :D
[04:53:23] <krackpot> Is it possible to place mroe than one skill in the hotbar from the same level group?
[04:53:50] <krackpot> Using Nephalem
[04:54:26] <TafferM> Oh,  no
[04:54:45] <krackpot> Only one per level group :(
[04:55:38] <TafferM> You can pick any skill,  just only one of each
[04:56:10] <krackpot> So no fist of thunder + lashing tail + blinding flash to the hotbar?
[05:01:32] <krackpot> I absolutely love that trap
[05:01:47] <krackpot> All I'd do is just try to string up huge combos
[05:02:18] <TafferM> Game makes it really fun to get chain kills
[05:07:52] <krackpot> Ugh. Might have to crash. Been up since 5 and it's 2 now :(
[05:08:15] <TafferM> No worries :) will upload this later

[07:46:22] <Darkie> sir
[07:46:23] <Darkie> right now yes
[07:47:05] <Darkie> but the usual slower speedrunner has the best weapon in the game (dagger) so they would be balanced
[07:47:45] <Eddga> I remember speedrunning half-life, I could complete it in an hour when the record was 45:45
[07:47:48] <Eddga> good times
[07:49:06] <Chaosteil> aw, the only speedruns I did were in metroid
[07:49:10] <Chaosteil> which is basically made for speedruns
[07:50:51] <Darkie> I only did speedruns in assassin's creed 2
[07:51:00] <Darkie> but that's because I didn't want to do too much overtime at work :))
[07:51:02] <Anime> pj caught up :O
[07:55:45] <Taffer> that was awesome!
[07:57:04] <Taffer> is that speed run of d1 even possible?
[07:57:48] <Eddga> yeah, someone did it in 3 minutes or so
[07:57:53] <Eddga> with duping bug
[08:00:29] <Taffer> what about the bug with the next level stairs contantly being right next to each other
[08:01:56] <Eddga> that too

[08:22:02] <Chaosteil> race of what? I feel so uneducated
[08:22:08] <Chaosteil> did you do the speedrun of d1 next to someone else?
[08:22:13] <Darkie> http://www.twitch.tv/speeddemosarchivesda
[08:22:25] <Darkie> the guys here were racing in castlevania
[08:22:27] <Taffer> they just did ghost and goblins
[08:22:28] <Darkie> speedruns
[08:22:29] <Chaosteil> ah
[08:22:31] <Chaosteil> thx
[08:22:36] <Taffer> they are about to race castlevania 1
[08:22:41] <Anime> who won?
[08:22:46] <Taffer> guy on the right
[08:22:50] <Anime> kareshi?
[08:22:59] <Taffer> don't know their names really :(
[08:23:08] <Anime> pj and kareshi, dunno which is which tho hahaha
[08:23:09] <Darkie> if it was on the right, it was probably pj
[08:23:14] <Taffer> the skinny dude
[08:24:09] <Anime> i remember as a child seeing those megaman and smb3 speedruns and being O________O by it not knowing they were TAS
[08:24:24] <Taffer> TAS?
[08:24:29] <Anime> tool assisted speedruns
[08:24:42] <Taffer> I hate those
[08:24:43] <Anime> the ones where they so each section perfectly
[08:24:46] <Taffer> that was the mario one
[08:25:01] <Taffer> that's removing the human element way too much
[08:25:04] <Anime> i dont 'hate', its just another category
[08:25:12] <Chaosteil> i personally love to see the tas of super metroid
[08:25:15] <Chaosteil> they're just insane
[08:25:16] <Anime> you still have to path your way through 
[08:25:31] <Anime> and what you do is what defines if you are faster or not
[08:25:42] <Taffer> writing a program to play it for you is removing you from the game
[08:25:52] <Anime> nono
[08:25:56] <Anime> its not a prog
[08:26:03] <Anime> they play them 
[08:26:05] <Taffer> ah explain tool assisted
[08:26:26] <Anime> for instance, load states
[08:26:38] <Anime> you save for each microsecond played
[08:26:45] <Anime> if it wasnt perfect the way you wanted
[08:26:47] <Anime> load and do it again
[08:26:55] <Anime> after 93028928529019 times you get the whole run
[08:27:00] <Anime> thats one example
[08:27:03] <Taffer> that is like unlimited retrys
[08:27:06] <Anime> there might be others
[08:27:06] <Anime> yup
[08:27:13] <Taffer> anyone can get anything perfected with time
[08:27:26] <Taffer> the skill is being able to do it in one run
[08:27:41] <Chaosteil> it's tool assisted, not "tool done"
[08:27:50] <Anime> but thats the secret, imagine you 'made' a perf run and finished with 1h10m
[08:28:06] <Taffer> that's like giving the game the ability to pause and reload
[08:28:07] <Anime> in your mind everything was pefect, until you find someone that made it in a whole hour
[08:28:16] <Taffer> you are giving the thief game mechanic to a game
[08:28:18] <Anime> he could squeeze extra 10mins which you gotta find out where
[08:28:19] <Taffer> not thief
[08:28:22] <Taffer> I mean prince of persia
[08:28:30] <Chaosteil> that's why they are in a separate category
[08:28:36] <Chaosteil> they're.. art in itself
[08:29:11] <Taffer> I agree with that
[08:29:33] <Taffer> and people that need to practice can find certain areas they need tow ork on
[08:30:22] <Anime> the guy with a black blanket/cape(o.o)?
[08:30:33] <Taffer> it's fitting
[08:30:44] <Chaosteil> looks like a snuggie
[08:31:04] <Darkie> it's a cape actually
[08:31:10] <Taffer> is someone playing the real piano?
[08:31:20] <Taffer> oh shit
[08:31:21] <Darkie> yeah
[08:31:22] <Taffer> in the back
[08:31:24] <Darkie> he's at the back
[08:31:25] <Taffer> that's so awesome
[08:31:53] <Taffer> he's good too
[08:31:55] <Darkie> those fingers got a good workout
[08:32:33] <Anime> hahahahahahah
[08:32:35] <Anime> nice
[08:32:37] <Chaosteil> that's real good
[08:32:55] <Anime> wish i could make music :/
[08:33:00] <Taffer> me too anime
[08:33:02] <Taffer> you're not alone
[08:33:20] <Chaosteil> wish I could do art :(
[08:33:44] <Taffer> just enjoy art :D just as good
[08:33:51] <Darkie> it takes practice
[08:33:54] <Chaosteil> there's got to be some "drawing and painting for engineers"
[08:34:08] <Taffer> it's called architecture :D
[08:34:15] <Chaosteil> :(
[08:34:18] <Anime> music and drawing
[08:34:31] <Taffer> music is an engineer piece of waves
[08:34:42] <Taffer> you are creating comfort zones with tones
[08:35:00] <Chaosteil> if it was engineered, we could figure out an algorithm to make the perfect music
[08:35:08] <Chaosteil> too much random
[08:35:10] <Taffer> yeah, it's called daft punk
[08:35:13] <Taffer> robot rock
[08:35:16] <Chaosteil> and that's why it's sad
[08:35:23] <Chaosteil> :V
[08:35:35] <Chaosteil> and that 2 hour music video of theirs
[08:35:56] <Darkie> a friend's of mine is making a music generator program as part of his university degree
[08:35:59] <Anime> the piano guy needs a synth to account for the sfx too or else its crap

[09:12:55] <Thunderclaww> as the Deckard Cain kid did
[09:14:20] <Chaosteil> I wonder if he got ridiculed for this or not
[09:15:12] <Thunderclaww> For what?
[09:15:43] <Chaosteil> for having a name like that
[09:16:06] <Chaosteil> he might've just been too young for that
[09:16:21] <Anime> i never been there at all too>P
[09:16:23] <Thunderclaww> I think he's 16 or so now
[09:16:38] <Thunderclaww> so he was only 1 when the contest was done
[09:17:13] <Anime> i saw some posts of his on reddit
[09:17:20] <Anime> theres his pic and a credit card
[09:17:31] <Anime> can't recall if it was an ama
[09:17:50] <Thunderclaww> T'was just an information post, I believe, but he did answer some questions

[13:46:34] <TafferM> And the record holder
[13:48:13] <TafferM> He already turbo jumped
[13:49:40] <Chaosteil> is it me, or does he hold the controller like a fight stick?
[13:49:47] <Chaosteil> *was holding
[13:50:03] <TafferM> Probably a trick move
[13:50:20] <TafferM> I don't understand the final fantasy bets on names
[14:41:42] <TafferM> LoZ is roguelike?

[22:21:45] <TafferM> In your opinion (anyone)  what is the best diablo wiki.  
[22:38:49] *** Quits: jab416171 (u2058@irccloud.com) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[23:07:04] <krackpot> What are the ones out there?
[23:07:08] <krackpot> And for what game?
[23:07:12] <krackpot> 1, 2, upcoming 3?
[23:08:15] <krackpot> I kinda wanted to start my own D3 site, but I don't think I'd have that much time to maintain it
[23:09:46] *** Quits: ctZorgNotZerg (~Zorg@99-28-0-107.lightspeed.milwwi.sbcglobal.net) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:17:57] <TafferM> For d3,  but it's hard to pick a winner for it,  so the best d2 one may be better?

[23:18:51] <Taffer> OOT speed run now :D
[23:18:57] <Taffer> but I am going to run and get taco bell
[23:21:03] <krackpot> What are all the D3 wikis?
[23:21:32] <Taffer> let me look them up in a sec, decided I am not going
[23:21:40] <krackpot> Heh
[23:21:49] <Taffer> reason I asked is because I want to know which one to search for info and which one to actually edit my self
[23:22:08] <krackpot> The folks in here should just make our own D3 site
[23:22:17] <Taffer> and if reddit got behind one of the wikis, I want it to be the best one
[23:22:22] <Taffer> that would be awesome
[23:22:37] <krackpot> I'd definitely be interested in it
[23:22:59] <Taffer> http://speeddemosarchive.com/
[23:45:21] <Taffer> http://www.diablowiki.net/Main_Page
[23:46:01] <Taffer> I like that one the most so far
[23:46:40] <Taffer> they were the leading wiki for d2
[23:46:43] <Taffer> http://diablo2.diablowiki.net/Runewordss
[23:49:58] <Taffer> cosmo is legit
