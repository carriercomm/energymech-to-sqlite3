[09:07:04] <ZeDestructor> since then I keep redoing a playthrough with people

[09:11:26] <ZeDestructor> i.e: i basically only did the tute
[09:11:36] <Taffer> I ran them for a while and the only way I was able to keep people is with the MH =/
[09:11:49] <ZeDestructor> wish I could play online...
[09:11:58] <ZeDestructor> but 500ms puts a stop to that
[09:11:59] <Chaosteil> I played classic for only a week or so :|
[09:12:06] <ZeDestructor> afk, going out
[09:12:10] <Chaosteil> oh, we're you located, destructor?
[09:12:11] <Taffer> layer
[09:12:13] <Taffer> later
[09:12:18] <Chaosteil> *where are

[09:12:48] <ZeDestructor> /AFK
[09:12:52] <Chaosteil> oh cool
[09:12:54] <Chaosteil> but I see
[09:12:56] <Chaosteil> sorry man
[09:12:58] <Chaosteil> laters
[09:15:32] <Taffer> not really into metal slug
[09:17:22] <Chaosteil> metal slug was great
[09:17:35] <Taffer> it looks fun to play
[09:17:46] <Chaosteil> it really is
[09:17:59] <Chaosteil> had really great polish for its time
[09:18:05] <Taffer> there is a chat channel for vgmusic on esper net
[09:18:09] <Taffer>  #vgmusic
[09:18:23] <Taffer> I can see that, the 2d sprite graphics look really good
[09:18:41] <Chaosteil> hah, vgmusic. I listen to that exclusively as of late
[09:18:49] <Chaosteil> kinda weird
[09:18:51] <Chaosteil> but awesome
[09:19:08] <Taffer> know the command to see the list of all the channels? eh I will find it
[09:19:24] <Taffer> I downloaded mIRC so I am going to regular multiple channels
[09:19:37] <Taffer> they even have a idlerpg on here haha
[09:19:50] <Chaosteil> I'm using mibbit and am connected to 3 servers at once
[09:19:51] <Chaosteil> loving it
[09:20:29] <Chaosteil> the only thing they need is remote settings storage access, so I could use it on my phone too or some other stuff
[09:20:34] <Chaosteil> android support in short
[09:20:43] <Taffer> problem with irc on the phone is that it only works on wifi
[09:20:48] <Taffer> it sometimes works on the network
[09:20:51] <Taffer> but it kicks you a lot
[09:21:10] <Chaosteil> hm
[09:21:15] <Taffer> I would be on more in lab if it worked
[09:21:32] <ZeDestructor> Get a bnc
[09:21:41] <Taffer> bnc?
[09:21:43] <ZeDestructor> Liek me
[09:21:50] <ZeDestructor> A bouncer
[09:22:02] <Taffer> I don't need protection
[09:22:09] <Chaosteil> oh man, I haven't heard that term for a while now
[09:22:11] <Chaosteil> good old times
[09:22:23] <ZeDestructor> No, but multi-client, and no dc
[09:22:51] <Taffer> I read a few tricks to make it work, but it wasn't worth it since I should be working anyways
[09:22:56] <ZeDestructor> I'm on Android via 3g right now
[09:23:00] <Taffer> but I will look into it because sometimes would be fun to chat with you guys
[09:23:04] <Taffer> "sometimes"
[09:23:08] <Chaosteil> hey hey
[09:23:27] <Chaosteil> WHAT SHOULD I TAKE FROM THAT EXPRESSION, MISTER?
[09:23:28] <ZeDestructor> :p
[09:23:44] <Taffer> I wonder if there is a rougelike chat on here
[09:23:51] <Taffer> I'm on the hunt
[09:24:03] <Chaosteil> esper is mostly about minecraft
[09:24:05] <Chaosteil> sorry to break the news
[09:24:19] <Taffer> I like minecraft
[09:24:30] <Chaosteil> well hell yeahs me too
[09:24:31] <Taffer> I was told that we should of joined a different server
[09:24:42] <Taffer> but starcraft does fine on here
[09:24:44] <Chaosteil> starcraft is here, I see nothing bad about that
[09:24:45] <Chaosteil> yeah
[09:25:11] <Chaosteil> and quakenet doesn't allow mibbit clients :(
[09:25:45] <Taffer> quakenet annoys me
[09:25:49] <Taffer> but has good people
[09:25:59] <Taffer> there is a rogue like chat room
[09:26:05] <Taffer> so I am happy
[09:26:26] <Taffer> minecraft has tons of people
[09:26:36] <Chaosteil> quakenet has very excellent communities
[09:27:18] *** Quits: world (lahwran@2001:41d0:1:8d75::148) (*.net *.split)
[09:27:33] <Taffer> I would like to win over some of the diablo people though, I remember someone telling us that there were a bunch of fanatics in a different server
[09:28:00] <Chaosteil> really? that would be cool
[09:28:17] <Chaosteil> though I guess we're more of a d3 community than anything else
[09:28:27] <Taffer> yeah but if they got like 50 regulars and we got 25, can't ask them to leave
[09:28:35] <Taffer> yeah true
[09:28:50] <Chaosteil> so I guess we'll still get our influx
[09:29:00] <Taffer> on release
[09:29:12] <Chaosteil> precisely
[09:29:31] <Chaosteil> and I can't wait
[09:29:47] <Chaosteil> hey, there are probably going to be chat channels ingame, like in starcraft
[09:29:54] <Chaosteil> so I guess we take #rdiablo?
[09:30:06] <Chaosteil> or just #reddit?
[09:30:08] <Taffer> if that happens yeah
[09:30:11] <Taffer> probably reddit
[09:30:15] <Chaosteil> aye
[09:30:16] <Taffer> but they will fill up fast
[09:30:20] <Taffer> starcraft has max 100 people
[09:30:24] <Chaosteil> yeah
[09:30:26] <Taffer> so they do reddit1 2 and so on
[09:30:29] <Chaosteil> but nowadays not so many anymore
[09:30:39] <Chaosteil> barely any, tbh
[09:30:54] <Chaosteil> mostly because the interface isn't the most convenient one
[09:31:05] <Taffer> I hope you can read chat while in game
[09:31:07] <Chaosteil> because you have to manually open the channels you want to join
[09:31:10] <Taffer> I will be happy then
[09:31:13] <Chaosteil> yeah
[09:31:19] <Taffer> but I will be playing windowed mode and having this one too
[09:31:22] <Taffer> on*
[09:31:40] *** furyhunter_ is now known as furyhunter
[09:31:47] <Chaosteil> at first I'll disconnect from everywhere else
[09:31:50] <Chaosteil> just enjoy the game
[09:32:02] <Taffer> I think I want to absorb the story through normal
[09:32:04] <Chaosteil> then I'll whip out excel and play myself into ruin
[09:32:07] <Taffer> but my friends would be upset
[09:32:19] <Chaosteil> I will play my first runthrough alone
[09:32:26] <Chaosteil> clicking everything I can
[09:32:27] <Eddga> same
[09:33:01] <Taffer> i wonder if they make boss runs so nerfed and not viable if you will still need to get help to rush forward
[09:33:33] <Taffer> I hope what they mean by "soloable through inferno" is that by inferno you have almost the best gear
[09:34:09] <Chaosteil> I still can't solo d2lod hell properly
[09:34:15] <Chaosteil> I think they know what they are doing
[09:34:35] <Chaosteil> I mean, what's the point of getting better items if you can solo it with sorta-good items anyway?
[09:34:36] <Taffer> ditto
[09:34:44] <Taffer> stupid magic and physical immunes

[12:47:58] <newborn> or is it out already?
[12:48:03] <Taffer> get a Wii, simply for zelda
[12:48:08] <newborn> yeah its kind of hard to buy a console now
[12:48:10] <newborn> this late in the generation
[12:48:13] <Anime> i was playing ff12 on the computer
[12:48:15] <Chaosteil> I have a wii, yeah
[12:48:17] <Anime> pretty fine actually
[12:48:19] <newborn> although technically there's nothing announced yet anyway
[12:48:34] <newborn> so you might have another 2-3 years with it
[12:48:35] <Taffer> microsoft has something planned with windows 8
[12:48:40] <newborn> before the XBOX720 and PS4
[12:48:43] <newborn> or whatever
[12:48:44] <Taffer> I bet the new console is a small PC with windows 8
[12:48:54] <Chaosteil> they did that with the first xbox already
[12:48:57] <Taffer> would be a smart move
[12:49:05] <Taffer> I mean even more mainstream
[12:49:15] <Taffer> you will be able to play any 360 game with windows 8
[12:49:37] <Chaosteil> I doubt so
[12:49:46] <Taffer> and 360 controller for PC is pretty commmon, I love mine
[12:49:48] <Chaosteil> 360 _is_ specialized hardware after all
[12:49:53] <Chaosteil> I have one too, two even
[12:49:59] <newborn> i love my 360 personally

[12:50:22] <newborn> what kind of site is that??
[12:50:23] <newborn> never heard of it
[12:50:24] <Chaosteil> Microsoft has not made an official statement about the feature yet. 
[12:50:45] <Chaosteil> xbox360 has a three-core non-pentium machine
[12:51:10] <Chaosteil> now explain me how you would want to run xbox360 games on a completely different processor without significantly killing performance 
[12:51:39] <Taffer> http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20078855-1/rumor-windows-8-will-play-xbox-360-games/
[12:51:42] <Taffer> cnet better?
[12:51:53] <newborn> yes thank you :)
[12:51:57] <Taffer> I know rumor
[12:51:57] <newborn> im an elitist
[12:52:02] <Chaosteil> I really call bull on this
[12:52:03] <Chaosteil> sorry
[12:52:09] <Chaosteil> that's just not how hardware works
[12:52:23] <Anime> http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&DEPA=0&Order=BESTMATCH&N=-1&isNodeId=1&Description=radeon+7970&x=0&y=0 :o
[12:52:27] <Chaosteil> even the wii had a gamecube chip to simulate gamecube games, even though the architectural differences where at minimum
[12:52:46] <Anime> sony had psp emulators all the time
[12:53:06] <Taffer> I think microsoft could make a OS that mimics old hardware
[12:53:16] <Anime> nintendo had their official one leaked
[12:55:52] <Chaosteil> those emulators are really not up to snuff
[12:56:09] <Chaosteil> they're just for some automatic testing, the best you can do is always with real hardware
[12:56:20] <Taffer> yeah but an entire kernal dedicated to it would make it run much better
[12:56:42] <Chaosteil> I think you rather need a chip dedicated to it
[12:56:59] <Chaosteil> the xbox360 is a three-core machine, not counting the specific gfx card that's in it
[12:58:17] <Chaosteil> a dedicated kernel module still will need to translate the whole code of powerpc to x64 or whatever you're running, losing performance in that case
[12:58:29] <Chaosteil> if they did it, I would be really astounded by that
[12:58:35] <Chaosteil> but currently I'm calling bull, that's all
[12:58:49] <Taffer> it could be bull, but wishful thinking on my part

[18:05:26] <Thunderclaww> I haven't felt so violent towards someone in my life as towards Lamar Smith after reading this article: http://t.co/LmY3YSTo

[18:14:44] <Anime> does this guy "use" the internet or its just one of those oldies that checks e-mails from her daughter across the country and pays the phone bill with it?
[18:15:24] <Thunderclaww> I don't know, but I still want to hurt him so much
[18:19:14] <Thunderclaww> The problem with SOPA and PIPA is that most people still don't know about it
[18:19:36] <Thunderclaww> Americans mostly get news from TV, and all of the TV networks are in favor of SOPA
[18:20:27] <Thunderclaww> Google, Facebook, and Twitter need to do their black-out really soon
[18:21:21] <Thunderclaww> I'm curious to see what would happen if Google and Facebook get requests to close down if SOPA and PIPA pass
[18:22:43] <Thunderclaww> Also, Taffer and Xiphirx, why no Ops?
[18:23:05] <Kazeyonoma> goddamn, that guy
[18:23:07] <Kazeyonoma> so ... ugh
[18:24:05] <Thunderclaww> I read that article last night just as I was about to go to sleep
[18:24:49] <Thunderclaww> Stayed up because I couldn't fall asleep over my need to punch him
[18:26:30] <Kazeyonoma> if you watched any of the live proceedings in december
[18:26:32] <Kazeyonoma> the guy is a douche
[18:26:38] <Kazeyonoma> he just cuts off opponents mid speech
[18:26:44] <Kazeyonoma> tries to prevent proper votes from being taken
[18:26:56] <Kazeyonoma> and uses a ton of shady tactics to try to proceed as fast as he can
[18:31:05] <Anime> >_>
[18:31:21] <Anime> <Thunderclaww> Google, Facebook, and Twitter need to do their black-out really soon
[18:31:36] <Thunderclaww> They do
[18:31:38] <Anime> i dunno whats that but i suppose its a simulation of what their site would be with sopa?
[18:31:42] <Anime> or else, whats that?
[18:32:19] <Thunderclaww> Well, they're planning to turn almost everything black and leave a link to something anti-SOPA
[18:32:40] <Thunderclaww> because if there are any sites that Americans visit, it's those three
[18:34:31] <Anime> true
[18:36:52] <Thunderclaww> Very amusing satirical comic about the Republican debates: http://amultiverse.com/2012/01/09/race-to-the-bottom/
[18:37:18] <Thunderclaww> read the little paragraph under the comic as well
